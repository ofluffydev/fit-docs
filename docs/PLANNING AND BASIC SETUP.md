# Game idea:
First person
Main weapon will be the sword you find, the sword is a magic object that speaks to you telepathically. Possibly add another weapon or have the sword switch forms for each time?
10 levels will be made for the project, each a different "time"
Once a level is complete you will continue to the next level through "Time fractures"
1. Time-bending mechanics: Use your time-manipulation device to slow down time, rewind, or create time loops to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles.
2. Era-spanning adventure: Travel through various historical periods, each with its own unique challenges, environments, and characters.
3. Branching storyline: Your choices throughout the game impact the timeline, leading to different outcomes and multiple endings.
4. Upgrade system: Collect chronon energy to upgrade your time-manipulation device and unlock new abilities.
5. Engaging combat: Battle time-displaced creatures and bosses using a combination of weapons and time-bending powers.
6. Immersive storytelling: Uncover the mystery behind the fractured timeline through dialogue, lore entries, and cinematic cutscenes.
